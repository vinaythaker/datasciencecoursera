The runalaysis.R script contains two functions.  

1. run_analysis() function takes no argument and works against the data set in the assignment provided it is in the current directory.  
2. read_set() function is an internal helper function takes two arguments and is used to read training set and the test set files

To get the output set run the run_analysis() function with no arguments.  

**good luck!**
